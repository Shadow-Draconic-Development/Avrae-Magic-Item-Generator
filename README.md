<h1>Magic Item Generator<img align="right" src="./Data/images/main.png" width="100px"></h1>

Content library that allows users to randomize magic item loot selections in Avrae. This magic item generator allows administrators to customize which magic items can be rolled (with slight limitation). Initially without setup, this magic item generator only allows items that are from the Basic Rules (2014). Upon setup, you can have magic items from any sourcebook or even homebrew items.
